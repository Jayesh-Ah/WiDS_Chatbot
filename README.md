# ðŸ¤– PDF Chatbot using Python, Spacy, NumPy, and Streamlit

## ðŸ›  Project Overview  
This project focuses on developing an intelligent PDF chatbot application that allows users to upload PDF files, extract text, and interact with the content through natural language queries. Built using **Python**, this application leverages powerful libraries like **Spacy** for natural language processing, **NumPy** for efficient data handling, and **Streamlit** for creating an interactive user interface. Additionally, the chatbot utilizes the **Langchain** embedding model for advanced text processing.

### How It Works  
1. **PDF Upload**: Users can upload PDF files directly through the Streamlit interface.
2. **Text Extraction & Chunking**: The application extracts text from the uploaded PDFs and splits it into smaller, manageable chunks for efficient processing.
3. **NLP & Embedding Generation**: Using **Spacy**, the chunks are processed to generate embeddings, which are then stored in a **NumPy**-based database.
4. **Query Input & Response**: Users input queries, and the chatbot retrieves relevant text chunks based on similarity scores, providing the most contextually accurate responses.

## ðŸ“‚ Resources Used  
- **Python**: The core programming language used for developing the application.
- **Spacy**: A powerful NLP library used for tasks like text tokenization, chunking, and embedding generation.
- **NumPy**: Used for handling numerical data and creating the database of text embeddings.
- **Streamlit**: A framework for creating an interactive and user-friendly web interface, enabling seamless user interactions with the chatbot.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features  
- **PDF Upload and Text Extraction**: Upload PDF documents and automatically extract text content for analysis and querying.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Process text data using **Spacy** to tokenize, chunk, and generate embeddings.
- **Intelligent Query Handling**: Users can input natural language queries, and the chatbot returns the most relevant text sections based on similarity scores.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with **Streamlit**, providing a simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with the chatbot.

## ðŸ“š Learning Experience  
Throughout this project, I gained hands-on experience with several key techniques in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:
- **Text Tokenization and Chunking**: Breaking down large documents into manageable pieces for efficient processing.
- **Embedding Generation**: Using advanced NLP models to convert text chunks into vector embeddings for similarity matching.
- **Building Web Applications**: Creating interactive, real-time web applications using **Streamlit** to enhance the user experience.

## ðŸš€ Future Enhancements  
- **Improved Retrieval Mechanism**: Implement more sophisticated algorithms for retrieving the most contextually relevant responses to user queries.
- **Advanced NLP Techniques**: Integrate more NLP techniques, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) or topic modeling, to provide deeper insights into user queries.
- **Enhanced User Interface**: Continue refining the Streamlit interface for better usability and a more polished user experience.
