# PDF Chatbot using Python, Spacy, NumPy, and Streamlit
This project aims to develop a PDF chatbot application using Python along with libraries like Spacy, NumPy, and Streamlit. Throughout the project, I learned about natural language processing (NLP) techniques and utilized the Langchain embedding model for text processing.

# Project Overview
The PDF chatbot allows users to upload PDF files, extract text, and convert it into chunks for processing. Using Spacy for NLP tasks, the application generates embeddings for text chunks and stores them in a NumPy database. Users can then input queries, and the chatbot retrieves relevant chunks based on similarity scores, providing context using Streamlit.

# Resources Used
Python: Programming language used for development.
Spacy: NLP library utilized for text processing and embedding generation.
NumPy: Library for numerical computing, used for handling arrays and databases.
Streamlit: Framework for building interactive web applications, used for user interface development.

# Learning Experience
Throughout the project, I gained hands-on experience with NLP techniques, including text tokenization, chunking, and embedding generation. The utilization of Spacy and Langchain provided insights into advanced text processing methodologies. Additionally, working with Streamlit enhanced my skills in building interactive web applications.

# Future Enhancements
Potential enhancements for the project include improving the chatbot's retrieval mechanism for more accurate results, integrating additional NLP techniques for better understanding of user queries, and enhancing the user interface for a more intuitive experience.

Feel free to explore the project and contribute to its development!
